# Inoffical mapping script for Durgod Keyboards

Since there is no Mac/Linux version of the Durgod Zeus Engine, the aim of this tool is to provide a simple replacement script for all platforms.

Tested with Tarus K320. 

USE ON YOUR OWN RISK.


## Installation

    pip install hidapi


## Usage:

    ./remap.py keymaps/taurus_k320

After running I have to activate the profile on my keyboard using `Fn`+ `MR`(F12)
