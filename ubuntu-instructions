Ubuntu installation and usage instructions
Tested on kubuntu 20.10.
The pip installs may be redundant, as apt may be doing the same thing.


First you will need some libraries:
pip install hid
pip install hidapi
sudo apt install python3-hidapi libhidapi-dev python3-hid

The script needs to run as root:

turn off the MR mapping [M] light should be off
sudo ./remap.py keymaps/taurus_k320  (this will give you a listing of the standard key codes)
sudo ./remap.py keymaps/taurus_k320-dvorak 
turn on the MR mapping [M] light should on and new dvorak mapping installed.

Now my K320 works in dvorak mode!  
The durgod windows utility as of 1.0.2.2 still fails to remap the "_" underscore key correctly.
